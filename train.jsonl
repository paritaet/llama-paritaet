{"text": "<title>Hard Times In New York Town</title> <lyrics>Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song\n\nSing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong\n\nJust a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell\n\n’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well\n\nIt’s hard times in the city\n\nLivin’ down in New York town\n\n\n\nOld New York City is a friendly old town\n\nFrom Washington Heights to Harlem on down\n\nThere’s a-mighty many people all millin’ all around\n\nThey’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down\n\nIt’s hard times in the city\n\nLivin’ down in New York town\n\n\n\nIt’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate\n\nTo Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State.\n\nMister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird\n\nOld Mister Empire never says a word\n\nIt’s hard times from the country\n\nLivin’ down in New York town\n\n\n\nWell, it’s up in the mornin’ tryin’ to find a job of work\n\nStand in one place till your feet begin to hurt\n\nIf you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry\n\nIf you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry\n\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\n\nLivin’ down in New York town\n\n\n\nMister Hudson come a-sailin’ down the stream\n\nAnd old Mister Minuet paid for his dream\n\nBought your city on a one-way track\n\n’F I had my way I’d sell it right back\n\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\n\nLivin’ down in New York town\n\n\n\nI’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay\n\n’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains\n\n’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines\n\nIt’s all much cleaner than the New York kind\n\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\n\nLivin’ down in New York town\n\n\n\nSo all you newsy people, spread the news around\n\nYou c’n listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song\n\nYou c’n step on my name, you c’n try ’n’ get me beat\n\nWhen I leave New York, I’ll be standin’ on my feet\n\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\n\nLivin’ down in New York town</lyrics>"}
{"text": "<title>Man on the street</title> <lyrics>’ll sing you a song, ain’t very long\n\n’Bout an old man who never done wrong\n\nHow he died nobody can say\n\nThey found him dead in the street one day\n\n\n\nWell, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn\n\nAt the man whose clothes ’n’ shoes were torn\n\nThere on the sidewalk he did lay\n\nThey stopped ’n’ stared ’n’ walked their way\n\n\n\nWell, the p’liceman come and he looked around\n\n“Get up, old man, or I’m a-takin’ you down”\n\nHe jabbed him once with his billy club\n\nAnd the old man then rolled off the curb\n\n\n\nWell, he jabbed him again and loudly said\n\n“Call the wagon; this man is dead”\n\nThe wagon come, they loaded him in\n\nI never saw the man again\n\n\n\nI’ve sung you my song, it ain’t very long\n\n’Bout an old man who never done wrong\n\nHow he died no one can say\n\nThey found him dead in the street one day</lyrics>"}
