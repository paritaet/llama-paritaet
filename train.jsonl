{"text": "A song about Mother of Muses: Mother of Muses sing for me Sing of the mountains and the deep dark sea Sing of the lakes and the nymphs in the forest Sing your hearts out - all you women of the chorus Sing of honor and fame and of glory be Mother of Muses, sing for me Mother of Muses sing for my heart Sing for a love too soon to depart Sing of the Heroes who stood alone Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone Who struggled with pain so the world could go free Mother of Muses, sing for me Sing of Sherman - Montgomery and Scott Sing of Zhukov and Patton and the battles they fought Who cleared the path for Presley to sing Who carved out the path for Martin Luther King Who did what they did and then went on their way Man, I could tell their stories all day I\u2019m falling in love with Calliope She doesn\u2019t belong to anybody - why not give her to me She\u2019s speaking to me, speaking with her eyes I\u2019ve grown so tired of chasing lies Mother of Muses wherever you are I\u2019ve already outlived my life by far Mother of Muses unleash your wrath Things I can\u2019t see - they\u2019re blocking my path Show me your wisdom - tell me my fate Put me upright - make me walk straight Forge my identity from the inside out You know what I\u2019m talking about Take me to the river and release your charms Let me lay down in your sweet lovin\u2019 arms Wake me - shake me - free me from sin Make me invisible like the wind Got a mind to ramble - got a mind to roam I\u2019m travelin\u2019 light and I\u2019m slow coming home"}
{"text": "A song about I Contain Multitudes: Today and tomorrow and yesterday too The flowers are dying like all things do Follow me close - I\u2019m going to Bally-Na-Lee I\u2019ll lose my mind if you don\u2019t come with me I fuss with my hair and I fight blood feuds . . . I contain multitudes Gotta tell tale heart like Mr. Poe Got skeletons in the walls of people you know I\u2019ll drink to the truth of things that we said I\u2019ll drink to the man that shares your bed I paint landscapes - I paint nudes . . . I contain multitudes A red Cadillac and a black moustache Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash Tell me what\u2019s next - what shall we do Half my soul baby belongs to you I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes . . . I contain multitudes I\u2019m just like Anne Frank - like Indiana Jones And them British bad boys the Rolling Stones I go right to the edge - I go right to the end I go right where all things lost - are made good again I sing the songs of experience like William Blake I have no apologies to make Everything\u2019s flowin\u2019 all at the same time I live on the boulevard of crime I drive fast cars and I eat fast foods . . . I contain multitudes Pink pedal pushers and red blue jeans All the pretty maids and all the old queens All the old queens from all my past lives I carry four pistols and two large knives I\u2019m a man of contradictions and a man of many moods . . . I contain multitudes Greedy old wolf - I\u2019ll show you my heart But not all of it - only the hateful part I\u2019ll sell you down the river - I\u2019ll put a price on your head What more can I tell ya - I sleep with life and death in the same bed Get lost Madam - get up off my knee Keep your mouth away from me I\u2019ll keep the path open - the path in my mind I\u2019ll see to it that there\u2019s no love left behind I play Beethoven sonatas Chopin\u2019s preludes . . . I contain multitudes"}
